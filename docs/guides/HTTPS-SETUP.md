# HTTPS & Custom CA Certificate

SoundTouch speakers communicate with cloud services over HTTPS. For the local service to work over HTTPS, speakers must trust the AfterTouch Root CA. The service manages this automatically — it generates a CA on first start and the web UI guides you through installing it on each speaker as part of the migration flow.

> ### ⚠️ Speakers connect to `:443`, AfterTouch defaults to `:8443`
>
> Speakers build their target URLs from Bose hostnames *without* an explicit port, so they connect on the default HTTPS port **443**. AfterTouch's built-in HTTPS listener defaults to **8443** because port 443 is privileged on most Unix systems.
>
> **If you do nothing, speakers will fail with `Curl 7` / connection refused and nothing will appear in the AfterTouch HTTP log.**
>
> Pick one of the three options under [Binding to port 443](#binding-to-port-443) below. The settings page in the web UI shows a ✅ / ❌ indicator for `:443` reachability so you can confirm the routing is in place.

## How TLS works in AfterTouch

The service includes a built-in HTTPS listener (default port `8443`) that presents a certificate covering all Bose cloud hostnames. The certificate is signed by the AfterTouch Root CA, which is generated automatically on first start and stored in `data/certs/`.

**Domain coverage** — the certificate covers:
- Wildcard: `*.api.bose.io`, `*.api.bosecm.com`
- Specific: `streaming.bose.com`, `bmx.bose.com`, `stats.bose.com`, `updates.bose.com`, `worldwide.bose.com`, `bose-prod.apigee.net`, `media.bose.io`, `downloads.bose.com`, `voice.api.bose.io`, and more

> **Note**: The hostname you configure as `HTTPS_SERVER_URL` (e.g. `https://soundtouch.fritz.box:8443`) is also added as a Subject Alternative Name, ensuring valid TLS for direct browser or API access.

## CA trust installation (via web UI)

The migration flow in the web UI includes a CA trust step that:
1. Uploads the Root CA to the speaker via SSH
2. Appends it to the speaker's shared trust store (`/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt`)
3. Verifies connectivity over HTTPS

This is handled automatically — you don't need to manage CA files manually unless you're doing an advanced or manual setup.

---

## Downloading the CA certificate

You can download the Root CA for manual installation on other devices (phones, PCs, additional speakers):

```
http://<server>:8000/setup/ca.crt
```

## Binding to port 443

Speakers expect HTTPS on the default port 443. Since binding to port 443 requires elevated privileges, you have three options:

1. **Port forwarding (recommended)**: Run the service on port 8443 and forward port 443 to it using `iptables` or your firewall/router. Inside an LXC/Docker container or on the host:

    ```bash
    iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 443 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8443
    iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT     -p tcp --dport 443 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8443
    ```

    The first rule covers traffic arriving from speakers; the second covers loopback connections from the host itself (useful for the in-built pre-flight probe).

2. **Capabilities**: Grant the binary permission to bind low ports and start the listener directly on `:443`:

    ```bash
    sudo setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' ./soundtouch-service
    ./soundtouch-service --https-port=443
    ```

3. **Reverse proxy**: Use Nginx or Caddy on `:443` in front of the service (see below).

### Confirming `:443` is reachable

After applying any of the options above, open the AfterTouch web UI → **Settings**. The Target Domain row will show a second line:

* ✅ `:443 reachable on localhost and <IP> (forwarded to :8443)` — you're good.
* ❌ `Speakers connect to :443 but AfterTouch listens on :8443.` — the routing is missing or not yet active.

A third line follows from the browser itself, which sits on the LAN exactly where the speakers do. The browser can't distinguish an untrusted-CA TLS error from a connection refusal, so it uses timing as a heuristic: a fast error means "no listener / firewall reset", a slower one means "something answered TCP". When the server-side and browser-side checks disagree, the UI flags it — that almost always means NAT, split-horizon DNS, or a host firewall sitting between AfterTouch and the LAN.

The same check runs once at service startup and prints a `[WARN]` log line if `:443` is unreachable, with the exact iptables/setcap commands for your current listener port.

#### When this check is shown

The `:443` indicator is only displayed when **AfterTouch's DNS interception is enabled** (Settings → "Enable DNS Discovery Server"). The check is only meaningful for the **DNS migration method**, where speakers reach AfterTouch via intercepted Bose hostnames and therefore on the implicit `:443`. The other migration method — writing direct `https://<host>:8443/...` URLs into the speaker's private config via SSH — uses the port that's literally in the URL, so `:443` is irrelevant and the check would only add noise.

If you intercept Bose hostnames **outside** AfterTouch (Pi-hole, router DNS rule, `/etc/hosts` on a gateway), the UI gate above will hide the indicator. The data is still in the `GET /setup/settings` JSON response (`https_443_localhost_reachable`, `https_443_lan_reachable`, `https_443_lan_host`) if you want to inspect it directly, or you can briefly enable AfterTouch's DNS server to see the indicator render.

## Reverse proxy (optional)

If you prefer to use Nginx or another proxy for TLS termination:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name streaming.bose.com bmx.bose.com stats.bose.com updates.bose.com;

    ssl_certificate /path/to/data/certs/server.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/data/certs/server.key;

    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2;
    ssl_ciphers 'ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:AES128-GCM-SHA256:AES256-GCM-SHA384';

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
```

> **Tell the service to honour `X-Real-IP`/`X-Forwarded-For`.** When deploying
> behind a reverse proxy on the same host as above, set
> `"trust_forwarded_headers": true` in `data/settings.json`. With that flag
> on, the service rewrites `r.RemoteAddr` from the proxy-supplied headers,
> so handlers that act on the source IP (e.g. the Spotify priming triggered
> by `/marge/streaming/support/power_on`) see the speaker's real address
> instead of the proxy's loopback peer.
>
> By default only `127.0.0.0/8` and `::1/128` are trusted to set those
> headers. If your reverse proxy lives on a different host, list its CIDR(s)
> in `"trusted_proxy_cidrs"` (e.g. `["10.0.0.0/8"]`). Do **not** enable
> `trust_forwarded_headers` on a flat LAN deployment without a proxy: a
> malicious speaker on the LAN can send the headers itself and spoof its
> source IP.

## Manual CA injection (advanced)

If you need to inject the CA manually (e.g. without the web UI migration flow):

```bash
# Copy the CA to the speaker
scp data/certs/ca.crt root@<SPEAKER-IP>:/tmp/

# Make the filesystem writable and append the CA to the trust store
ssh root@<SPEAKER-IP> "(rw || mount -o remount,rw /) && cat /tmp/ca.crt >> /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt"
```

## TLS compatibility

SoundTouch speakers run OpenSSL 1.0.2, supporting up to TLS 1.2. The service is configured accordingly:

- **Minimum TLS version**: TLS 1.2
- **Preferred cipher suites**: `ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256`, `ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384`, `ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305`
- **Legacy support**: `RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256`, `RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384`
