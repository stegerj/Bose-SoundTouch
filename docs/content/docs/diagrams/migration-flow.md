# Migration Flow Diagrams

This document specifies the diagrams needed for the migration guide, with descriptions that can be used to create actual visual diagrams.

## 1. Overall Migration Process Flow

### Description
A flowchart showing the complete migration journey from start to finish.

### Elements
```
[Start] → [Install SoundTouch Service] → [Create Account] → [Prepare Devices]
    ↓
[Enable Remote Services] → [Discover Devices] → [Register Devices]
    ↓
[Start Migration] → [Data Collection Phase] → [Testing Phase] → [Full Local Phase]
    ↓
[Verify Migration] → [Complete] → [Post-Migration Setup]
```

### Decision Points
- Multiple devices? → Repeat device steps
- Migration issues? → Rollback option
- All devices complete? → Account fully migrated

### Color Coding
- **Blue**: Service setup steps
- **Green**: Successful completion states
- **Orange**: In-progress/testing states
- **Red**: Error handling/rollback paths
- **Gray**: Optional steps

## 2. Network Topology Diagram

### Description
Shows the network layout with Raspberry Pi, router, and SoundTouch devices.

### Components
```
Internet Cloud
    ↑↓ (Optional - during migration)
Home Router (192.0.2.1)
    ├── Raspberry Pi (192.0.2.10) [SoundTouch Service]
    ├── Living Room Speaker (192.0.2.100)
    ├── Kitchen Speaker (192.0.2.101)
    ├── Bedroom Speaker (192.0.2.102)
    └── Office Speaker (192.0.2.103)
```

### Connections
- **Solid lines**: Active connections
- **Dashed lines**: Migration-phase connections to Bose cloud
- **Thick lines**: Primary data flow to local service

## 3. Device State Lifecycle

### Description
State machine showing device progression through migration phases.

### States and Transitions
```
[Unregistered] → [Discovered] → [Registered] → [Migrating]
                                                    ↓
[Active - Local Only] ← [Active - Testing] ← [Active - Data Collection]
    ↑                                              ↓
[Error/Rollback] ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← [Migration Failed]
```

### State Descriptions
- **Unregistered**: Device not known to service
- **Discovered**: Found on network, remote services enabled
- **Registered**: Added to account, ready for migration
- **Migrating - Data Collection**: Building local database
- **Migrating - Testing**: Using local service with fallback
- **Active - Local Only**: Full independence achieved
- **Error/Rollback**: Issues detected, can revert to Bose

## 4. Data Flow During Migration

### Description
Shows how data flows between components during different migration phases.

### Phase 1 - Data Collection
```
SoundTouch Device → Bose Cloud Services
                ↓ (mirror)
            Local Service (collecting data)
```

### Phase 2 - Testing
```
SoundTouch Device ↔ Local Service (primary)
                ↕ (fallback when needed)
            Bose Cloud Services
```

### Phase 3 - Full Local
```
SoundTouch Device ↔ Local Service (only)

Bose Cloud Services (disconnected)
```

### Data Types
- **Presets**: Station favorites and custom sources
- **Recents**: Play history and recently accessed content
- **Sources**: Configured music services (Spotify, etc.)
- **Device Config**: Network settings, capabilities, metadata

## 5. Migration Timeline Visualization

### Description
Gantt-chart style timeline showing typical migration schedule.

### Timeline (7-day example)
```
Day 1-2: Data Collection Phase
         ████████████████████████████████████████
         
Day 3-4: Data Validation
               ████████████████████████████
               
Day 5-6: Testing Phase  
                     ████████████████████████
                     
Day 7+:  Full Local Operation
                           ████████████████████████→
```

### Parallel Activities
- Multiple devices can be in different phases
- Service continues operating throughout
- User can interact normally during process

## 6. Service Architecture Overview

### Description
High-level architecture showing enhanced SoundTouch service components.

### Components
```
Web Dashboard ← → HTTP API ← → REST Endpoints
      ↑               ↑              ↑
      └─── User ──────┼──── Devices ─┘
                      ↓
              Service Core
              ├── Account Manager
              ├── Device Lifecycle
              ├── Event Processor
              ├── Migration Controller
              └── Data Store
                      ↓
              File System Storage
              ├── accounts/
              ├── devices/
              ├── sessions/ (existing)
              └── system/
```

### External Integrations
- **Bose Cloud** (during migration)
- **Music Services** (Spotify, TuneIn, etc.)
- **Discovery Services** (mDNS, UPnP)

## 7. Error Handling and Rollback Flow

### Description
Decision tree for handling migration issues and rollback scenarios.

### Error Detection
```
Migration Issue Detected
    ├── Device Unresponsive → Retry → Success/Rollback
    ├── Data Corruption → Restore from Backup → Continue/Rollback  
    ├── Service Unavailable → Wait/Restart → Continue/Rollback
    └── User Dissatisfaction → Manual Rollback → Restore Bose Config
```

### Rollback Process
```
[Rollback Initiated]
    ↓
[Disable Local Services]
    ↓
[Restore Original Device Config]
    ↓
[Re-enable Bose Services]
    ↓
[Verify Functionality]
    ↓
[Rollback Complete]
```

## Implementation Notes
