# SoundTouch Device Initial Setup Variants

Based on community research from the **SoundCork** and **ÜberBöse API** projects, as well as analysis of the Stockholm firmware (`firmware/Stockholm/.../setup/`), this document outlines the methods used for the "out-of-the-box" setup of SoundTouch devices.

## Setup Overview

Initial setup is the process of connecting a new or factory-reset device to a local Wi-Fi network and a Bose (or custom) account. This is distinct from the "Migration" process (handled by `soundtouch-service`), which redirects an already-configured device to a new server.

---

## 1. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Setup
Used by most modern SoundTouch devices (ST-10, ST-20/30 Series III, SoundTouch 300).

- **Mechanism**: The SoundTouch app communicates with the device over BLE to exchange Wi-Fi credentials.
- **Protocol**: Internal research refers to this as the **Gabbo** protocol (see `gabbo_setup_bco.js` in firmware).
- **Process**:
  1. Put the device in setup mode (usually by holding the '2' and '-' buttons).
  2. The app discovers the device via BLE.
  3. The app sends the Wi-Fi SSID and Password to the device.
  4. The device connects to Wi-Fi and disables BLE setup.

---

## 2. Access Point (AP) Mode / Web Setup
The classic "failover" or "alternate" setup method.

- **Mechanism**: The device creates its own Wi-Fi network (SSID: `Bose SoundTouch ...` or `Bose Home Speaker ...`).
- **IP Address**: Typically `192.0.2.1` (device-side, verified on ST10).
- **Web Interface**: The device hosts a web server on port 80.
- **Process**:
  1. Connect a PC/Phone to the device's Wi-Fi.
  2. Open a browser to `http://192.0.2.1`.
  3. The device serves a Wi-Fi setup form — enter your home network SSID and password and click Submit.
  4. The device disconnects from AP mode and joins your home network within ~15–30 seconds.

For command-line provisioning (without a browser), see §6 below.

---

## 3. Wireless Accessory Configuration (WAC)
Specific to Apple iOS devices.

- **Mechanism**: Uses Apple's MFi/WAC protocol to pass Wi-Fi settings from an iPhone/iPad directly to the device without manual password entry.
- **Status**: Detected automatically by iOS when a new SoundTouch device is in setup mode.

---

## 4. USB Setup (Legacy)
Primarily used for older SoundTouch Series I and II devices or as a last resort.

- **Mechanism**: Physical connection via Micro-USB to a computer running the SoundTouch Setup application.
- **Process**:
  1. Connect USB cable.
  2. The desktop app communicates via a proprietary HID or Serial-over-USB protocol.
  3. The app pushes Wi-Fi credentials.
  4. References to this exist in the firmware as `lost_USB_connection` and `connect_device` (see `setup_wizard.xml`).

---

## Technical Details: The "Gabbo" Protocol
The Stockholm firmware contains references to a communication layer called **Gabbo**.
- **File**: `setup/js/gabbo_setup_bco.js`
- **Function**: Handles the state machine for Wi-Fi connection, account pairing, and error handling during setup.
- **Relationship**: It appears to be an internal wrapper for the messages sent between the setup client (App or Browser) and the device firmware.

## Redirection during Setup
While the `soundtouch-service` focuses on migrating existing devices, a truly "clean" setup to a custom service would require:
1. Intercepting the initial account pairing request.
2. Providing a mock "Marge" service that accepts any credentials.
3. Patching the `SoundTouchSdkPrivateCfg.xml` during or immediately after the Wi-Fi connection phase.

## 5. Factory Reset Button Sequences

A factory reset wipes Wi-Fi credentials, account pairing, and all presets, returning the device to out-of-box state. The exact sequence varies by hardware generation.

> Sequences verified against official Bose reset guides in `firmware/FirmwareUpdateGuide/`. Confirm the reset succeeded by watching the status LEDs and by verifying the Wi-Fi indicator glows solid amber (setup mode).

| Model                    | Factory Restore Sequence                                            | Confirm                            |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| SoundTouch 10            | Power on; hold **Preset 1** + **Volume −** for 10 s                 | Wi-Fi indicator glows solid amber  |
| SoundTouch 20            | Power on; hold **Preset 1** + **Volume −** for 10 s                 | Lights blink L→R, then solid amber |
| SoundTouch 20 Series III | Hold **Preset 1** + **Preset 6** simultaneously for ~10 s           | White LED sweep                    |
| SoundTouch 30            | Power on; hold **Preset 1** + **Volume −** for 10 s (display counts down 10–1) | Display shows "Hold to restore factory settings", then restarts |
| SoundTouch 30 Series III | Hold **Preset 1** + **Preset 6** simultaneously for ~10 s           | White LED sweep                    |
| SoundTouch 300           | Hold **Volume −** until light bar blinks rapidly (~15 s)            | Rapid blink → off → on             |
| SoundTouch 10 (alt)      | Press and hold the back recessed **Reset** pinhole for 10 s         | Status LED restarts                |
| SoundTouch 20 (soft)     | Hold **AUX** for 15 s until display goes blank (settings preserved) | Display blanks                     |

After factory restore the speaker enters setup mode automatically; no power-cycle is needed.

## 6. AP Mode Wi-Fi Provisioning via Console

When BLE is unavailable (e.g. when using an Android emulator), use AP mode to push Wi-Fi credentials from the Mac command line.

### 6.1 Connect Mac to Speaker AP

After factory reset the speaker broadcasts an SSID like `Bose SoundTouch XXXX`. Connect the Mac to it:

```bash
# List nearby SSIDs — use System Settings → Wi-Fi (the airport command was removed in macOS Sequoia+)
# Connect (replace with actual SSID)
networksetup -setairportnetwork en0 "Bose SoundTouch XXXX"
```

The speaker's web UI gateway is at `192.0.2.1` (verified: ST10 assigns `192.0.2.2` to the client via DHCP).

```bash
# Confirm reachability
curl -sv http://192.0.2.1/ 2>&1 | head -40
```

### 6.2 Trigger Wi-Fi Site Survey (Optional)

The setup web UI at `http://192.0.2.1/` uses the SoundTouch API on **port 8090** — the same API as normal device operation. Trigger a network scan first so the speaker finds your SSID:

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://192.0.2.1:8090/performWirelessSiteSurvey \
  -H 'Content-Type: text/xml' \
  --data-raw '<PerformWirelessSiteSurvey timeout="5"/>'
```

### 6.3 Push Home Wi-Fi Credentials

```bash
HOME_SSID="MyHomeNetwork"
HOME_PASS="MyPassword"

curl -s -X POST http://192.0.2.1:8090/addWirelessProfile \
  -H 'Content-Type: text/xml' \
  --data-raw "<AddWirelessProfile><profile ssid=\"${HOME_SSID}\" password=\"${HOME_PASS}\" securityType=\"wpa_or_wpa2\" /></AddWirelessProfile>"
```

Expected response: `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?><AddWirelessProfileResponse />`

The speaker will disconnect from AP mode and join the home network within ~15–30 s.

### 6.4 Reconnect Mac to Home Network

```bash
networksetup -setairportnetwork en0 "MyHomeNetwork" "MyPassword"
```

Wait ~15 s for the speaker to join the home network, then verify:

```bash
# Discover the speaker's new IP via mDNS
dns-sd -B _soundtouch._tcp local &
sleep 5 ; kill %1
```

## Comparison: Initial Setup vs. Migration

| Feature          | Initial Setup          | Migration (soundtouch-service) |
|:-----------------|:-----------------------|:-------------------------------|
| **Connectivity** | BLE, AP Mode, USB, WAC | Ethernet/Wi-Fi (existing)      |
| **Credentials**  | Required (SSID/Pass)   | Not required (uses existing)   |
| **Access**       | Web UI / App protocol  | SSH (root)                     |
| **Primary File** | `setup/index.html`     | `SoundTouchSdkPrivateCfg.xml`  |
| **Use Case**     | Out-of-the-box / Reset | Redirecting active devices     |
