# soundtouch-web: remaining features

Four features complete the parity gap between soundtouch-web and the Stockholm
app's local-control functionality. Everything else in Stockholm (OAuth flows,
setup wizard, service account linking, onboarding, analytics) is cloud
infrastructure that is either shut down or already handled by soundtouch-service.

## 1. Seek / scrub

The progress bar already renders `NowPlaying.Time.Position` / `NowPlaying.Time.Total`
with a live 1 s ticker. What's missing is the ability to click or drag it to seek.

**Device API:** `POST /seek` with body `<seek deviceID="…" type="TIME_VALUE"><time>30</time></seek>`

**Backend:**
- Add `POST /api/device-seek/{id}/{seconds}` handler in `handler.go`
- Guard on `NowPlaying.SeekSupported.Value` — return 400 if the stream doesn't
  support seeking (radio, for example)

**Frontend (`NowPlaying.js`):**
- Replace the static `<div class="progress-bar">` with a `<input type="range">`
- `onInput` updates local state for smooth scrubbing; `onChange` (pointer up)
  fires `api.seek(deviceId, seconds)`
- Pause the 1 s ticker while the user is dragging to avoid fighting the input

**Client method to add (or verify exists):**
```go
func (c *Client) Seek(positionSeconds int) error {
    // POST /seek
}
```

## 2. Favorites

Mark or unmark the currently playing track as a favourite directly from the
Now Playing card.

**Device API:**
- `GET /favorites` — returns `<favorites>` list
- `POST /favorites` — adds current content item as a favourite
- `DELETE /favorites/{id}` — removes a favourite by ID

**Backend:**
- `GET /api/device-favorites/{id}` — fetch favourites list
- `POST /api/device-favorites/{id}` — add current now-playing item as favourite
- `DELETE /api/device-favorites/{id}/{favId}` — remove a favourite

**Frontend:**
- Heart button (♡ / ♥) in `NowPlaying.js`, next to the source label
- On mount (or when `nowPlaying` changes) fetch favourites and check whether
  the current `ContentItem.Location` is already in the list
- Toggle on click; optimistic UI update before the round-trip

**Note:** Not all sources support favourites. Check
`NowPlaying.FavoriteEnabled` — if the field is nil/absent, hide the button.

## 3. Device settings panel

A lightweight settings page per device covering the two most useful knobs:
rename and network/firmware info.

**Device API:**
- `GET /info` — device info (already fetched; stored as `DeviceInfo`)
- `POST /name` with body `<name>New Name</name>` — rename the device
- `GET /networkInfo` — IP, MAC, SSID, signal strength
- `GET /swUpdateStatus` — current firmware version and whether an update is
  available (not all devices expose this)

**Backend:**
- `POST /api/device-rename/{id}` — body `{"name":"…"}`; calls `POST /name`
- `GET /api/device-network/{id}` — proxies `GET /networkInfo`
- Optionally `GET /api/device-update-status/{id}` — proxies `GET /swUpdateStatus`

**Frontend:**
- Small ⚙ icon button in `DeviceDetail`'s page header (next to the power button)
- Navigates to a new `page === 'settings'` state in `App`; passes `deviceId`
- `DeviceSettings.js` component: editable name field (save on blur/Enter),
  read-only network info card, optional firmware version badge
- Back button returns to `'device'` page

## 4. Render stereo pairs as a single device

Today soundtouch-web shows the two halves of a stereo pair (formed via
`/addGroup` — see issue #252) as independent entries in the device list. The
Bose app collapsed a paired ST10 set into one "L+R" entry; restoring that
presentation closes the perception gap BirdyBA flagged at
<https://github.com/gesellix/Bose-SoundTouch/issues/252#issuecomment-4458140305>.

**Device API:**
- `GET /getGroup` on each speaker — returns the current `<group>` with
  `<masterDeviceId>` + `<roles>` (each `<groupRole>` carries the speaker's
  deviceId, role `LEFT|RIGHT`, and ipAddress)
- Empty `<group/>` means the speaker is standalone
- Querying the master and slave returns the same `<group>` payload, so either
  side is sufficient to detect the pair

**Backend:**
- During device-list assembly, call `GET /getGroup` for each discovered device
  in parallel (matches the propagation pattern already used by
  `soundtouch-cli group create` in `cmd/soundtouch-cli/cmd_group.go`)
- Bucket devices by `<masterDeviceId>` — each bucket emits one entry in the
  list response. Standalone devices stay as their own bucket-of-one
- Expose pair metadata on the list entry so the UI can render role chips
  (`L`/`R`) and resolve role → physical device for actions

**Frontend:**
- Device list collapses paired devices into one card titled with both names
  (e.g. `"Wohnzimmer L+R"`) and role chips
- Clicking the card opens a device-detail page that exposes both per-role
  status and a "Dissolve pair" action (DELETE flow, already wired in
  `soundtouch-cli group remove` and in fakespeaker's `/removeGroup` GET)
- Standalone speakers continue to render as today

**Note:** Pair lifecycle (create / rename / remove) already works
end-to-end — `pkg/client` group endpoints + `cmd/soundtouch-cli/cmd_group.go`,
covered by tests in `cmd/soundtouch-cli/cmd_group_test.go` and exercisable
against the fake speaker's group routes
(`pkg/service/testing/fakespeaker/fakespeaker.go`). This task is purely about
presentation in soundtouch-web's device list — no protocol work required.

## Decide later

| Feature                                | Reason                                                             |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Spotify / Pandora / Amazon browsing UI | Requires Bose cloud (shutting down); handled by soundtouch-service |
| Setup wizard (WiFi, Marge migration)   | Already in soundtouch-service setup flows                          |
| OAuth / login flows                    | Cloud-dependent; not needed for local network access               |
| AirPlay / Bluetooth pairing UI         | Device handles this independently; no SoundTouch Web API           |
| Onboarding, help, analytics            | Not relevant for a local control tool                              |
