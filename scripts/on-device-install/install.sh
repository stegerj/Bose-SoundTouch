# Default install location is /mnt/nv/aftertouch (the persistent
# partition), not /opt/aftertouch on rootfs. Stock SoundTouch rootfs
# has ~4 MB free on devices like the ST20 (issue #268); the
# AfterTouch binary is ~12 MB. /mnt/nv typically has tens of MB
# free and persists across reboots the same way /opt would.
#
# /opt/aftertouch becomes a symlink into the install target so the
# init script's hardcoded DAEMON path keeps working unchanged.
#
# Power users can override with INSTALL_DIR=/some/other/path.
