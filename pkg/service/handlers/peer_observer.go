// peerObserver is the rendezvous between the passive reachability probe
// (which registers interest in a device IP and waits for any inbound)
// and the chi middleware (which signals on every request whose source
// IP matches a registration).
//
// Unlike probeRegistry, which keys on a unique per-probe token, this
// observer keys on the device's IP — the probe doesn't mutate device
// state, so there's no token to thread through the request path. Any
// inbound from the IP counts as proof of reachability.
//
// PeerHit and the abstract handle interface live in the setup package
// alongside the probe logic; this type implements that interface.
